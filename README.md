# Nimród Kiss-Bartha - University Lecture Notes

## Introduction
This site contains my lecture notes that I wrote during my Bsc. studies at the Faculty of Informatics (Computer Science) of Eötvös Loránd University.

## Remarks
- All of my notes are written in $\LaTeX$ using TeXstudio. However, only the compiled `*.pdf` files are uploaded.
- All notes are written in Hungarian.
- The older the notes are, the more erroneous and / or imprecise they tend to be, so keep that in mind.
